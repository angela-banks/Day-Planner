Here is a day planner that is set up in html.

The events placed in the day planner are saved via local storage function/console.log via javascript.

The planner is a 9-5pm planner, with your current time attributed to the planner. 

The planner's textarea changes color based on the time to represent if an "event" (grey) has passed, that time block is open for new "events"(green) or if the "event" is overdue (red).
